# 🎓 Learning Space

Welcome to **Learning Space** — my personal repository where I document, experiment with, and refine my coding skills. This is where curiosity meets code, and ideas turn into practice.

## 📌 About

This repository serves as a dynamic notebook of my coding journey. It's a place for:
- Practicing algorithms and data structures
- Exploring new technologies and frameworks
- Building small projects and mini-tools
- Experimenting with concepts before applying them in production-level work

Whether it's frontend, backend, or full-stack — you'll find a variety of topics and stacks represented here.

## 🚀 Tech Stack I Explore

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB, MySQL (occasionally)
- **Others**: Git, GitHub, REST APIs, Firebase, Redis, Cloudinary

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `algorithms/` – Solutions to DSA problems
- `projects/` – Small-scale projects and MVPs
- `snippets/` – Handy reusable code blocks
- `playground/` – Experimental and scratch code

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen problem-solving and coding efficiency  
- Learn by doing — not just watching or reading  
- Track my progress over time  
- Keep code clean, reusable, and well-documented  

## 🧠 Mindset

> *"The best way to learn is by doing. The second best is by breaking things on purpose."*
