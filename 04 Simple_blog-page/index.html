                    Lalbagh Fort is one of the key tourist attractions of Dhaka City in Bangladesh. This is an unfinished
                    Mughal fort from the 17th century, the construction of which was started by a Mughal prince who was
                    the governor of Dhaka at that time. But when he left, the construction was not finished by the next
                    governor in charge because of a family tragedy. Nevertheless, the fort's massive size and the
                    structures inside bring many local tourists to the fort every day.
                    <br />
                    Located in the Lalbagh area in Old Dhaka and hence achieving its name, it is the most popular and
                    renowned fort and a great art signature by the Mughal Empire in Bangladesh. It is also known as Fort
                    Aurangabad. It is situated by the bank of the river Buriganga in rich red soil. For anyone visiting
                    Bangladesh, Lalbagh Fort is one of the must- visiting attractions.

            <b>The Construction of Lalbagh Fort</b> <br />
            Lalbagh Fort is an incomplete structure by a Mughal prince, and later emperor himself named Muhammad Azam (the
           third son of Aurangazeb). He started the work of the fort in 1678 during his vice-royalty in Bengal. He stayed
           in Bengal for 15 months. It remained incomplete when he was called by his father Aurangazeb to the capital,
           Delhi. Shaista Khan was the new Subedar (Governor) of Dhaka after Muhammad Azam, and he did not complete the
           fort. In 1684, the daughter of Shaista Khan named Iran Dukht (Pari Bibi) died there. After her death, he
           started to think of the fort as ominous and left the structure incomplete. Among the three major sections of
           the Fort, one is the tomb of Pari Bibi.

                Of the Mughal buildings inside the fort, Bibi Pari's Mausoleum is the most important, as it is a unique
                structure. It is the only building where black basalt from Rajmahal Hills, white marble from Rajputana,
                and encaustic tiles of various colors, have been used to decorate its interior.

                three domes. It is one of the finest examples of its kind, where the central dome is larger.
