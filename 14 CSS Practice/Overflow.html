        <p class="overflow">Digital marketing is the use of websites, apps, mobile devices, social media, search 
            engines, and other digital means to promote and sell products and services.

            Digital marketing involves many of the same principles as traditional marketing and 
            is often considered an additional way for companies to approach consumers and understand 
            their behavior. Companies often combine traditional and digital marketing techniques in 
            their strategies. But digital marketing also comes with its own set of challenges. 
            Digital marketing started to become popular with the widespread adoption of the internet 
            in the 1990s.</p>
            <h2 class="overflow">How Digital Marketing Works</h2>
            <p class="overflow">Marketing encompasses a wide range of techniques and media that companies can use to 
                promote their products and services to potential consumers and improve their market 
                share. To be successful, it requires a combination of advertising and sales savvy. 
                Professional marketers take on these tasks either internally at individual companies 
                or externally at marketing firms that may serve many different clients.</p>
